### Genomic data warehousing, file parsing, and RESTful web services made easy.

## About

Centromere is a set of tools for developing scalable data warehouses and RESTful web services.  It is designed to tackle the problems inherent in developing data warehouses for genomic data, where data structures can vary greatly and scale fast, and where use-cases must be flexible to accommodate shifting business needs.  Centromere is developed in Java using the open-source, enterprise-grade Spring Framework, is designed to support multiple database technologies (though currently, only MongoDB integration is configured).  You can use Centromere to create a new data warehouse from scratch, or bootstrap one or more existing databases, and make your data available via a customizable REST API.

Here are a few ways Centromere can help make your data warehouse and REST API better:

- Support classes for quickly creating data models and data access objects (DAOs).
- Components for reading standard column- and row-based data files, and rapidly developing extract-transform-load (ETL) pipelines.
- Spring Boot initializer for exposing your data repository as a REST web service with:
  - A flexible and easy-to-use query API
  - Simple token-based security
  - Automatic API documentation with [Swagger](https://swagger.io/)
  - Support for exporting data in JSON, XML and tab-delimited-table formats.

Centromere does _**not**_ contain a pre-defined data model, but rather provides you the tools to quickly generate your own model and expose your data through scalable repositories and web services.

## Documentation

Detailed documentation for Centromere can be found [in the 'docs' directory](docs/Introduction.md). JavaDocs can also be generated by [running the build script](#building). 

## Requirements

These are the current requirements for developing data warehouses with Centromere:

- Java JDK 8+
- Maven 3
- MongoDB 3.6+

\* Support for additional database technologies is coming soon. 

## Building

You can build the entire project using the supplied `build.sh` script:

```bash
./build.sh
```

This script will compile the project, run tests, generate reports and JavaDocs.

## Maven Artifacts

There are currently no recommended release version of Centromere available from Maven Central repository, though this should hopefully change in the near future.

```xml
COMING SOON
```
